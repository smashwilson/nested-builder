# TypeScript module template

It takes me way too long to remember how to set up all the infrastructure for a new npm module. This is a template repository intended to save some redundant work.

It's a basic but opinionated tech stack:

- TypeScript
- Prettier (formatting + linting)
- Mocha + Chai (tests + assertions)
